Modern CMake demonstration
==========================

This repository demonstrates basic usage of "modern CMake" (i. e. CMake >= 2.8)
with emphasis on packaging libraries. Versioning, cross-compilation and
subdirectories are not there yet, but planned.

*Backwards compatibility to CMake 0.0.1 is not there and not planned.*

This will be turned into a blog post in near future.
